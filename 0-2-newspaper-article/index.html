      <p>
        The hygge lifestyle can be for anyone and everyone — you just have to
        prioritize comfort. Your house should feel like a home, not cold and
        detached. When you extend your comfort to the outdoors, you build a
        space that offers several benefits and makes you feel right at home on
        your property.
      </p>
      <h2>What Is Hygge?</h2>
      <p>
        Hygge, a Danish word pronounced “hyoo-gah,” is a lifestyle that embraces
        coziness and the calm of life. You want to feel comfortable in your own
        home, and following a
        <a

          >[hygge lifestyle]</a
        >
        will let you relax — no more worrying about what other people may think
        about you or your home. You want your home to be welcoming and inviting,
        not necessarily look perfect on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
        To live a hygge lifestyle, all you need to do is prioritize human
        connection over gadgets or any other distractions. Building a
        comfortable home is the best way to focus on the things you love while
        avoiding the things that don't make you happy. Focus on soft things that
        bring you comfort, and decorate every inch of your house with purpose —
        including your backyard.

      <h2>Why Being Outdoors Is Great For You</h2>

      <p>
        Since you want to use every part of your home, you should ensure that
        your backyard is hospitable and makes you want to spend time outside.
        Being out in the sunlight can trigger physical growth and development,
        and it also plays a part in regulating your mental health. Spending time
        outside is directly linked to better physical and mental well-being.
        When you build a cozier outdoor space that becomes your hygge, you can
        enjoy every moment outside.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Level Up Your Backyard</h2>
      <p>
        You don't need the fanciest gadgets to have a backyard that invites
        people in. Just prioritize coziness and you'll draw people to your home.
        Your backyard is part of your home, so you should strive to make it as
        comforting as every other area of your home.
      </p>
      <h3>Hang Up Warm Lights</h3>
      <p>
        Adding lighting to your outdoor areas can make them feel cozier than
        before. Instead of relying on one main light to illuminate your space,
        you can make your whole space feel homier with several softer lights.
        Using more energy-efficient, quality lighting can even lower your energy
        use by almost 70%. In addition to saving money on your energy bills,
        you'll have a cozy backyard that welcomes family members and guests
        alike.
      </p>
      <h2>Soundproof Your Space</h2>
      <p>
        With a soundproofed backyard, you can spend time outside without
        worrying about too much noise leaking in or out. However, soundproofing
        your backyard is nothing like soundproofing a room. Instead of using
        artificial materials to act as a barrier, you can
        <a href="https://www.soundproofcow.com/soundproofing-tips-backyard/"
          >[lean into natural things]</a
        >, like shrubs and hedges, to help absorb some of the noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll add privacy to your backyard while ensuring you have plenty of
        clean air while outside. You can also opt for a fence to control some of
        the noise, making you a more responsible neighbor.
